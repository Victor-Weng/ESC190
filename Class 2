### Compiled Vs. Interpreted Languages

The PYthon interpreter is itself a program
-Big picture view: The Python interpreter reads the py file block by block and executes the code line by line
-Similar to how exec does this inside of a Python program

An alternative: compiled languages
-The computer hardware can (almost) directly execute instructions like move data
-Compilers translate human-readable code into computer-readable code

### Low-level vs. High-level languages

High-level languages are more abstract (e.g. Python)
-We don't spell out everything explicitly (for i in range: ... is abstract)

Low-level langages are more explicit (e.g. C)
-We have more control over the program and it can be written to be more efficient


## C: Low-level compiled language
## Python: High-level interpreted language

### Types in C

Unlike in Python, every C variable needs to be declared -- you need to pre-specify what type of data is stored in the variable
Types:
- int: Integer
- double: double-precision floating point (like float in Python)
- char: a character (e.g., '@','b')
- *type: pointer
