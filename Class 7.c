/*

typedef is also commonly used with structures
to avoid having to use the struct keyword when declaring variables. For example:

Now you can declare a Student variable like this:

Student s1;

Instead of like this:

struct Student s1;

Remember, typedef does not create a new type. It only creates a new name for an existing type.
The compiler treats the new name exactly the same as the original name.

Free function

Good practice to free() memory blocks to you allocated
C cannot use a malloc-ed block for something new until its freed
For continuously running programs, you might run out of memory (if you keep mallocing and not freeing)
On a modern OS, everything will be freed fater the program terminates
On less modern OS (older operating systems), or on very light OSs, it might not be the case
Memory leak: a situation where memory is allocated but never freed
